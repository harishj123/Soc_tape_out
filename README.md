# Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning

# 🚀 Task 1 – Chip Journey

A quick view of how a **C program becomes a real chip**:

1️⃣ **C Code** → Compile with GCC → ✅ Verified (O1)
2️⃣ **RTL Design** (Verilog/VHDL) → ✅ Verified (O2)
3️⃣ **ASIC Synthesis** → Gate-level Netlist/Macros/Analog IPs → ✅ Verified (O3)
4️⃣ **SoC Integration** → Processor + Peripherals + IPs
5️⃣ **Physical Design** → GDSII Layout → 🏭 Fabrication
6️⃣ **Post-Silicon Test** → Run same C testbench → ✅ Verified (O4)
7️⃣ **Applications** → Arduino, Smartwatches, TVs, ACs

✔️ Final Check:

```
O0 == O1 == O2 == O3 == O4
```

✨ ** Code → RTL → Chip → Real-world products.
