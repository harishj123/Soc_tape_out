# ⚡ Chip Modeling and SoC Design Flow
---

## 1️⃣ Application Stage (C Code)

* Applications (e.g., **Firefox, Mozilla**) are written in **C/C++**.
* Compiled using **GCC** → converts human readable source code into machine-readable instructions.
* ✅ **Output 0: Compiled Application (GCC)**

---

## 2️⃣ Specification Verification

* Application behavior is verified against the **C-model specifications**.
* ✅ **Output 1: Verified Specifications**

---

## 3️⃣ RTL Design (Soft Hardware)

* Hardware is described in **RTL (Verilog/VHDL)** → blueprint of the chip in code.
* ✅ **Output 2: Softcopy of Hardware (RTL Model)**

---

## 4️⃣ SoC Integration

* Processor, macros, and analog IPs are combined into a **microcontroller/SoC**.
* Step-by-step check:

  ```
  Output0 == Output1 == Output2 == Output3
  ```
* ✅ **Output 3: Integrated SoC**

---

## 5️⃣ Post-Silicon Testing with Peripherals

* The **same C testbench** is applied to the **fabricated chip with peripherals**.
* ✅ **Output 4: Verified Silicon Chip**
* Final verification:

  ```
  Output0 == Output1 == Output2 == Output3 == Output4
  ```

---

## 6️⃣ Physical Design (RTL → GDSII)

* Steps: Floorplanning → Placement → Clock Tree Synthesis → Routing
* Output: **GDSII file (chip layout with metal layers)**

---

## 7️⃣ Tapeout & Fabrication

* GDSII checked with **DRC/LVS** → sent to foundry (**Tapeout**)
* Fabricated chip received (**Tape-in**)

---

## 8️⃣ Market Applications

* Chip runs at **100–130 MHz** and is placed on a board.
* Target applications:

  * ⌚ Smartwatches (iWatch)
  * 🖥️ TV Panels
  * ❄️ AC Controllers
  * 🔧 **Arduino Boards** → ⭐ Most promising market
